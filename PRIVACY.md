**Base64 Buddy** helps developers and creators to:
- Encode and decode text or images to and from Base64 format

- Copy, clear, and manage encoded/decoded data efficiently  

Everything happens **entirely within your browser** — no internet connection or external servers are involved.

There are:
- ❌ No analytics or tracking tools

- ❌ No third-party integrations  
- ❌ No remote API calls  

Your files, text, and Base64 data never leave your device.

## 💾 Local Storage

Base64 Buddy may use your browser’s **Local Storage** only to save optional, non-sensitive preferences such as:
- Recently used Base64 history  
- Theme settings (light/dark mode)

All of this data is stored **locally** on your machine and can be cleared anytime.
